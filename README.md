# Pokémon Wordle Game

This is a fun and interactive Pokémon-themed Wordle game with two gameplay modes. The game challenges players to guess the Pokémon based on clues, including the Pokémon's dex number, typing, and abilities.

## Features

- **Easy Mode**: Players guess the Pokémon based on a blacked-out image, with 6 guesses. 
- **Harder Mode**: Players guess the Pokémon without any image, with 10 guesses.
- **Clues**: After each guess, players receive clues to help them narrow down their guesses:
  - Whether the Pokémon’s dex number is correct, higher, or lower.
  - Information about the Pokémon's typing and abilities.

## How to Play

1. **Easy Mode**: 
   - You will see a blacked-out image of a Pokémon. 
   - Guess the Pokémon's name.
   - You have 6 guesses to figure it out.

2. **Harder Mode**:
   - No image will be shown.
   - You will only have 10 guesses.
   - Use clues related to the Pokémon's dex number, typing, and abilities to guide your guesses.

## Inspiration

This game was inspired by a Star Wars Wordle game created by a friend on [swrdle.be](https://swrdle.be). I wanted to create a similar game, but with a Pokémon twist.
